		<description>All of my wallpapers ( I submitted 7 but only 1 was posted) do indeed frame the data on the lock screen by design.  Thanks for noticing the effort I made to make the photo blend with the day and date/time info.  Too many wallpapers, while nice, don&#039;t contrast well with WP7&#039;s Day/Date making it hard to read or covering up an integral part of the photo.  I submitted all of the photos at 480 X 800 so I don&#039;t know what went wrong there.  Sorry if it was my mistake.  Thanks for the compliment.</description>

		<description>I really like the way the hummingbird frames the data on the lock screen. Only criticism is that the resolution is just short of 480x800 so that scaling and cropping makes the pixels display less than 1:1. Thanks, nicely done.</description>

		<description>1 1/2 stars??  Are you kidding??  This isn&#039;t some bullshit I found on the web people, I took it myself after hours of waiting for a hummingbird to come within range.  Respect!</description>
